# Panacea
Panacea mod for Rimworld

Adds new surgery options:

- Reconstructive surgery: restores missing ears and noses
- Graft synthetic tissue: removes/reduces scars
- Graft synthetic digit: restores missing toes and fingers

Grafts use new Panacea resource crafted from Glitterworld medicine and Neutroamine at the drug lab after medicine crafting is researched.

Additionally adds new painkillers for pain treatment: Paradol and Methoxine. Buy them from traders or craft them at the drug lab once medicine crafting is researched.
